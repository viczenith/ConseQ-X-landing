## Technical Architecture: Deterministic & Explainable

### 🔬 **Deterministic Scoring Engine**
```javascript
// Exact formula implementation
scoreSystem(metrics, weights, requiredMetrics) => {
  score: 0-100,           // Weighted mean with bounds
  coverage: 0-1,          // Data completeness ratio
  confidence: 0-1,        // min(1.0, 0.5 + 0.5 * coverage)
  rationale: string       // Top 2 contributors explanation
}

computeOrgHealth(systemScores) => {
  orgHealth: 0-100,       // Weighted system average  
  confidence: 0-1,        // Average system coverage
  breakdown: Array        // Per-system details
}
```

### 🤖 **AI-Driven Insights (Mock → Production Ready)**
- **Cultural Analytics**: Collaboration index, innovation velocity, communication effectiveness
- **Cross-System Dependencies**: Automated bottleneck identification 
- **Predictive Forecasting**: 30-day health projections with risk areas
- **Transformation Readiness**: Organizational change capacity scoring

### 🏗️ **Service Architecture**
```
serviceSelector.js → mockService.js (deterministic) → apiService.js (production)
                  ↘ Environment-based switching (REACT_APP_USE_API=true)
```

2. **Serve Underserved Market**: SMEs and government agencies lacking consulting budgets  
3. **Add Value to Enterprises**: Layer strategic insight on top of existing operational systems
4. **Build Defensible Moat**: Purpose-built framework vs configurable generic tools

The analysis validates our approach: there's a clear differentiation opportunity between operational systems (ERP) and strategic consulting, exactly where our platform sits.

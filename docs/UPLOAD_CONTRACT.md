# Upload Contract

This document defines the minimal upload contract for the C-Suite Partner manual-upload flow.

Required metadata (send as separate JSON or include in filename/title):
- orgId: string
- uploadedBy: string (user email or id)
- timestamp: ISO-8601 string (optional — server will timestamp if absent)
- tags: array of strings (e.g. ["financials","feedback"]) — optional

Accepted file types and expectations
- CSV (.csv): tabular metrics. First row is headers. Use the sample templates in `public/sample-data/`.
- Excel (.xls/.xlsx): same structure as CSV but in sheets. Provide the sheet name if required.
- JSON (.json): nested data structures. Must be valid JSON.
- PDF (.pdf): reports; text extraction is best-effort and may require server-side processing for best results.

Validation rules (client-side)
- CSV must have at least one data row.
- Required columns depend on template (see sample templates). Missing required columns will show a validation error and suggested mapping.
- File size should be < 10MB for client-side processing. Larger files should be uploaded to the server for batch processing.

Processing contract
- Client-side: quick validation, preview, and queueing of small CSV/JSON files.
- Server-side (recommended for production): store file blob, run parsing & PII scanning, index text for RAG, run analysis jobs, and emit notifications (webhooks/email) when complete.

Failure modes
- 400: malformed file (e.g., invalid JSON)
- 413: file too large for client processing
- 422: schema validation failed (missing required columns)

Examples
- Sample CSV templates are available under `public/sample-data/` — use these to format uploads.

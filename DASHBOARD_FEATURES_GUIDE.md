## Connection Status Indicator

### Purpose
The **Connection Status** shows real-time data connectivity for live organizational monitoring. It indicates whether the dashboard can receive:

- Live system performance updates
- Real-time organizational health metrics
- Instant alerts for critical issues
- Continuous monitoring capabilities

### Status Types

#### üü¢ **Connected (Live)**
- **Meaning**: Real-time WebSocket connection active
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Live system updates every 5-10 seconds
  - Real-time organizational health monitoring
  - Instant alerts and notifications
  - Continuous data synchronization

#### üî¥ **Offline**
- **Meaning**: WebSocket connection failed or unavailable
- **Impact**:
  - No live updates
  - Using cached/historical data only
  - Real-time monitoring unavailable
  - Manual refresh required for updates

### Enabling Live Connection

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system
- Access to localhost ports 4001-4002

#### Steps to Enable
1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
2. **Navigate to project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd "path/to/ceo-assessment-app"
   ```

3. **Start Mock WebSocket Server**:
   ```bash
   node server/mockWsServer.js
   ```
   You should see: `Mock WS Server listening on ws://localhost:4002`

4. **Start Mock API Server** (optional, for enhanced features):
   ```bash
   node server/mockApi.js
   ```
   You should see: `Mock API listening on http://localhost:4001`

5. **Refresh Dashboard**: The connection indicator should change to "Connected"

#### Troubleshooting
- **Port Already in Use**: Try closing other applications using ports 4001-4002
- **Permission Issues**: Run terminal as administrator on Windows
- **Connection Still Failing**: Check firewall settings for localhost connections

### Live Data Features (When Connected)
- **Real-time System Scores**: Live updates of all 6 organizational systems
- **Performance Trends**: Continuous tracking of organizational health changes
